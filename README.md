## Overview
This repository contains two Python exercises using the Pandas library. Each exercise focuses on manipulating and extracting information from a CSV dataset containing car-related information.


### Problem 1: Basic DataFrame Operations
#### Instruction 
- The CSV file should be located in the same directory as the Python file, and its path should be passed to pandas.read_csv().
- Use the head() and tail() methods of the DataFrame to display the rows.
#### Task
- a. Load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame named cars.
- b. Display the first five and last five rows of the DataFrame.

### Problem 2: Advanced DataFrame Operations
#### Instructions
- Use slicing, subsetting, and indexing techniques for these operations.
- Ensure the output is clear and informative.
#### Task
Using the cars DataFrame from Problem 1, perform the following operations:
- a. Display the first five rows of cars, showing only the odd-numbered columns (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...).
- b. Find and display the row that contains the Model of Mazda RX4.
- c. Find the number of cylinders (cyl) for the car model Camaro Z28.
- d. Determine the number of cylinders (cyl) and gear type (gear) for the car models: Mazda RX4 Wag, Ford Pantera L, and Honda Civic.
